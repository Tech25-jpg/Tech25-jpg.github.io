    <h1>Kevin Teah's Website Evaluations</h1>
    <p>Here are my evaluations of two websites of my choosing; good and bad respectively.</p>

    <h2>Website Evaluation 1: Good Website</h2>
    
    <ol>
        <h3><a href="https://www.srb2.org/"><i>Sonic Robo Blast 2 Official Website [Homepage]</i></a></h3>
            <li><b>Contrast</b></li>: Light text on a dark background for good readability. You don't have to feel the need to squint to get a closer look. The standard white text, black background's easy on the eyes.
            <li><b>Repetition</b></li>: Consistent use of layout and color scheme through the site. It doesn't feel overcomplicated during navigation.
            <li><b>Alignment</b></li>: Elements are aligned consistently in center, creating an organized and professional appearance. Clear and concise in getting its message across.
            <li><b>Proximity</b></li>: Related elements are grouped together, making it easier to understand the content and navigate the site. For example, the side bar (Download, Addons & More, etc).
    </ol>
    
    <h2>Website Evaluation 2: Bad Website</h2>
    
    <ol></ol>
        <h3><a href="https://museum.lingscars.com/feature/website.php#models"><i>LingsCars</i></a></h3>
             <li><b>Contrast</b></li>: Poor contrast between text and background colors, making it difficult to read. The clashing colors strain the eyes and make it hard to focus on the content that is being proposed.
            <li><b>Repetition</b></li>: Inconsistent use of layout and color scheme throughout the site. It feels cluttered and disorganized, not clear and concise at all.
            <li><b>Alignment</b></li>: Elements are misaligned, creating a chaotic appearance. Text and images are not properly aligned, making it hard to follow the content.
            <li><b>Proximity</b></li>: Related elements are scattered across the page, making it difficult to understand the relationships between different sections of information being presented.
    </ol>
